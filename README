DietCOLA (Discrete COLA) solves Mixed Integer Second Order Cone Optimization
(MISOCO) problems.

This code is developed by modifying COIN-OR's ALPS library example Abc (A
Branch and Cut) solver, which solves Mixed Integer Linear Optimization
problems. Basicly I replaced linear solver with COLA. This transition is
easy since COLA implements conic extension of OSI. This extended interface
is called Conic OSI and can be found at
https://github.com/aykutbulut/OSI-CONIC

DietCOLA is similar in design to Goez's MISOCO solver Iclops.
