Uses Conic extension of COIN-OR's OSI solver.

Does not depend IPopt or gsl (gnu-scientific library).

Uses its own procedures to solve separation problem.

Can handle problems that are unbounded without conic constraints. Generates a
	supporting hyperplane in such case. For this solves an optimization
	problem. It is fast.
